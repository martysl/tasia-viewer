# Project Status

## Current Phase

Linux viewer builds and runs with FMOD.

Current branch: `feature/tasia-giphy-welcome-loading-linux`.

Current feature work: GIPHY/welcome/loading improvements are being implemented on Linux first, then ported to Windows after Linux success.

Next work:
1. **Grid lock**: remove/block Second Life and add I-Grid Beta.
2. **Version/build identity**: internal 8.0.1, display 8.0.1.<GitHub run number>, show short commit SHA.
3. **Snapshot system**: replace Flickr/Primfeed with real TasiaFeed upload.
4. **TasiaFeed backend**: PHP + DB + WebDAV storage under apps.easierit.org/igrid/feed/.
5. **Bug reporting**: adapt BugSplat/crash reporter into real TasiaBugReport/TasiaCrash.
6. **Bug backend**: PHP + DB/admin under apps.easierit.org/igrid/bugs/.
7. **Branding cleanup** while keeping legal credits intact.
8. **Manual Linux build** and test.

## 2026-05-18: GIPHY/welcome/loading branch status

### What is done
- Linux GitHub Actions build for the GIPHY/welcome/chat preview branch succeeded:
  - Run: `26061745761`
  - Commit: `d73371e429172ae53b943a81a10426c73949bafd`
- Linux prerelease published:
  - `https://github.com/martysl/tasia-viewer/releases/tag/v8.0.1-50`
  - Asset: `Phoenix-FirestormOSTasia-Releasex64_LEGACY-8-0-1-78266.tar.xz`
- Added build-time generated obfuscated GIPHY API key fallback support.
- Added generated-file ignores for:
  - `indra/newview/lltasia_giphy_key.generated.h`
  - `indra/newview/lltasia_giphy_key.generated.cpp`
- Added runtime key accessor files:
  - `indra/newview/lltasia_giphy_key.h`
  - `indra/newview/lltasia_giphy_key.cpp`
- Added generator script:
  - `scripts/generate_tasia_giphy_key.py`
- Wired Linux workflow configure step to pass `TASIA_GIPHY_API_KEY` from GitHub Secrets without printing it.
- Added Tasia settings for welcome text, GIPHY, animated chat preview, and optional loading YouTube embed.
- Added async welcome text client:
  - `indra/newview/lltasia_welcome_client.h`
  - `indra/newview/lltasia_welcome_client.cpp`
- Hooked `LLProgressView` to request one random usable line during startup loading and ignore late responses after startup completes.
- Added standalone GIPHY API client:
  - `indra/newview/llgiphyclient.h`
  - `indra/newview/llgiphyclient.cpp`
- `LLGiphyClient` supports search/trending, safe key lookup, rating setting, JSON parsing, and `GIPHY is not configured.` fallback.
- Added registered GIPHY picker floater shell:
  - `indra/newview/llfloatergiphypicker.h`
  - `indra/newview/llfloatergiphypicker.cpp`
  - `indra/newview/skins/default/xui/en/floater_giphy_picker.xml`
- Registered floater as `giphy_picker` in `indra/newview/llviewerfloaterreg.cpp`.
- Added nearby chat `GIF` button in `indra/newview/skins/default/xui/en/floater_fs_nearby_chat.xml`.
- Wired nearby chat button to `LLFloaterGiphyPicker`; selected GIF sends the normal GIPHY page URL through existing nearby chat send path.
- Added local GIPHY URL preview cards in `indra/newview/fschathistory.cpp`, gated by `TasiaAnimatedGifChatPreview`.
- Added direct image URL previews in `indra/newview/fschathistory.cpp`, gated by `TasiaImageChatPreview`.
- Added inline YouTube embeds in `indra/newview/fschathistory.cpp`, gated by `TasiaYouTubeChatPreview` and enabled by default.
- Confirmed active nearby chat and Firestorm IM use `FSChatHistory`; legacy `LLChatHistory` path is currently disabled by `#if 0`.
- Added loading panel branding text and `Powered by GIPHY` credit in `indra/newview/skins/default/xui/en/panel_progress.xml`.
- Added optional loading YouTube embed behavior in `LLProgressView`, gated by `TasiaLoadingYouTubeEnabled` and `TasiaLoadingYouTubeURL`; loading media is disabled by default.

### What is broken
- No known breakage from the current edits.
- Full animated thumbnail rendering inside chat is still not implemented; current chat preview is a safe local GIPHY card with an external open button.
- Linux build succeeded, but runtime testing of the released package is still needed.

### What was last attempted
- Generated empty local fallback key files with no secret present.
- Tested the generator with a fake key under `/tmp/opencode` and verified plaintext is not written.
- Parsed `indra/newview/app_settings/settings.xml` successfully.
- Ran `git diff --check` successfully.
- Added welcome client/progress hook and reran focused XML/whitespace checks successfully.
- Added `LLGiphyClient` and reran focused XML/whitespace/script checks successfully.
- Added `LLFloaterGiphyPicker`, registered it, added XUI, and reran focused XML/whitespace/script checks successfully.
- Wired nearby chat GIPHY button/selection send path and reran focused XML/whitespace/script checks successfully.
- Added GIPHY chat preview cards, loading branding/GIPHY credit, optional YouTube loading media, and reran focused XML/whitespace/script checks successfully.
- Enabled loading YouTube by default, added image URL chat previews, verified active IM coverage through `FSChatHistory`, and reran focused XML/whitespace/script checks successfully.
- Corrected YouTube behavior: chat/IM YouTube embeds are now enabled by default via `TasiaYouTubeChatPreview`; loading YouTube is optional/off by default. Focused checks passed again.
- Published Linux prerelease `v8.0.1-50` from successful run `26061745761`.

### Exact last failing step
- None in this session.

### What must not be changed
- Do not hardcode, print, commit, or document the real GIPHY API key.
- Do not commit generated GIPHY key files.
- Do not disturb the known-good Windows build path while Linux feature work is incomplete.
- Keep Linux feature work on `feature/tasia-giphy-welcome-loading-linux` until Linux build succeeds.

### Next exact action
- Test Linux prerelease `v8.0.1-50` locally. If runtime is good, port the feature branch to Windows and run the Windows build.
